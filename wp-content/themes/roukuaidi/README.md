## Custom Fields

ACF is used heavily to let content editors manage most of site content. The main difference here is that all the fields are configured via YAML files using ACF Windsor composer package. These YAML files are stored in `THEME/acf-fields/` directory, where the full list of all ACF field groups can be viewed in the `index.yaml` file. For more information, consult [documentation](https://windsor-docs.netlify.app/)
